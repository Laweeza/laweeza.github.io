### Part 2

While designing the schemas for my database, I found clear relations between the users, questions, and answers. I had a hard time creating schemas with Mongoose, even when I tried to embed the documents. Mapping out the data into relational tables seemed more intuitive to me.

MongoDB/Mongoose initially seemed really appealing since I felt that it would allow me to quickly play with the schemas. It was more flexible than a relational database. Relational databases like mySQL and PostgresQL seemed a bit rigid, and I was also worried about scaling limitations.


I was also unfamiliar with PostgresQL, so I had to weigh whether or not learning new database syntax would be reasonable due to time constraints. However, I used mySQL before, and after a cursory read through the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/), saw that there was some overlap between the two types of relational databases.
