Hi, I'm Louisa, a mutation of software engineering and pharmacy.

### My Story

Growing up, I was a troublemaker and could never sit still in school.
Surprisingly, I did okay enough to become a pharmacist. I enjoyed working alongside my colleagues during patient care, but felt that something was missing. During my pharmacy graduate program, I was working on a minor in CS in addition to my PharmD, but decided that I wanted to graduate on time. Looking back, I regretted not pushing myself to pursue the 2 extra years of school.


Come 2021, I decided to enroll into a sofware development bootcamp. I wasn't right in the head, and still decided to work per diem during the immersive. The following months were some of most challenging and 'I Cri Evrytiem' times of my life. I had a strong case of imposter syndrome, but my determination fought back, and I ended up graduating from the program on January 2022. While honing my skills as a programmer, I realized that I loved the dopamine hit that came with solving complex problems.

I am excited for the next chapters of my journey, and look forward to growing and learning with fellow engineers in the community!
